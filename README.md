##This project involves the creation of a Chrome extension called "Focus Track", designed to help users monitor and visualize their productivity by tracking the amount of time they spend focusing on active tabs in their browser. The goal is to provide users with insights into how they spend their time online and encourage better time management and focus habits.

The extension uses modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is powered by a background service worker and a popup UI. The service worker runs in the background, continuously monitoring tab activity, while the popup provides users with an interface to view their focus data, typically displayed using visual elements like a bar or pie chart.

The project setup begins by creating a specific folder structure that includes the manifest file, icons, background scripts, content files, and a popup interface. The manifest.json file is the core configuration file that defines the extensionâ€™s metadata, permissions, background scripts, and popup UI. In this case, it uses the Manifest V3 format, which is the latest version supported by Chrome and requires background scripts to be registered as service workers.
